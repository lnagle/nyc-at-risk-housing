## About

Housing stock is always in short supply in New York City. Although more is being built every day, it's clear that sea level changes and extreme weather due to climate change will have negative effects on the supply. This project uses NYC Open Data (https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/) to analyze the impacts of climate change on housing in NYC.

## Roadmap

- [x] Identify NYC Open Data sets that can be used in this analysis
- [x] Storyboard analysis
- [x] Write project overview and map NYC boroughs
- [x] Load extreme weather and sea level data from NYC Open Data
- [x] Contextualize and analyze map of flooding
- [ ] Map NYC housing
- [ ] Identify housing that's at risk due to sea level rise and flooding
  - [ ] Assess the impact to each borough individually
  - [ ] Assess the impact against the number of livable units specifically (buildings alone are too course grained)

### Backlog / Additional Avenues of Research
- [ ] Explore ways to get a more comprehensive view of where flooding occurs in light of the fact that the data set only maps places with flooding depths equal to or greater than 4 inches. For example, map [311 calls](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests-from-2010-to-Present/erm2-nwe9/about_data) related to flooding
- [ ] Examine the socioeconomics of neighborhoods that are impacted the most
  - For example, East Harlem seems to be particularly prone to flooding, whereas the Upper East Side is less so
- [ ] Compare projected impacts to data about the impacts of past extreme weather events. For example, hurricanes Sandy and Ida
- [ ] Expand analysis to include other impacts of climate change beyond housing. For example, effects on the subway system
- [ ] Run the same analysis against [2080 sea level rise and flooding projections](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/NYC-Stormwater-Flood-Map-Extreme-Flood-with-2080-S/w8eg-8ha6/about_data)
